# Transfer-Learning-with-Pytorch-and-gradCAM
This project aims to develop an understanding about the process of Transfer learning with Pytorch and also a way to showcase grad-CAM algorithm alongwith t-SNE plot. This model achieves a pretty good accuracy with resnet18 model. 
Though not perfect but can still detect Rock-Paper-Scissors pretty accurately with plain background.

Hope you'll like it!
