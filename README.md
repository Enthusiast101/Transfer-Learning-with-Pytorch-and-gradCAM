# Transfer-Learning-with-Pytorch-and-gradCAM
This project aims to develop an understanding about the process of Transfer learning with Pytorch and also a way to showcase grad-CAM algorithm alongwith t-SNE plot. This model achieves an accuracy of 90%+ with resnet18 model. 
Though not perfect but can still detect Rock-Paper-Scissor pretty accurately with plain background.

Hope you'll like it!
